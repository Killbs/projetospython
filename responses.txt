Hello everyone and welcome to my channel!

Today I'm going to be talking about the Nissan GTR. This car is an absolute beast and is one of the most popular sports cars on the market.

The GTR has a twin turbo V6 engine that produces an insane amount of power. It's also extremely light weight which makes it handle like a dream.

If you're looking for a fast and fun car, the GTR is definitely the way to go. Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed this video.
